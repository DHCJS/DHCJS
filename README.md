I am a self-taught Frontend Developer, a part-time Stock Trader and Photographer and living a devoted life as a Catholic. I am currently in the learning phase and trying to land my first job as a Frontend Developer. I write blogs to share my software engineering journey through the lens of my Catholic faith, which you can find on [Medium]( https://hartatociptajaya.medium.com/).

  My coding journey started when I took a sabbatical leave after being laid off from my job as operations manager in the food and beverages industry. I took a year of sabbatical leave to re-align my purpose, dreams and visions on how to live the best version of my life. As a starter, I wanted to become a cloud security engineer when looking for an opportunity in the tech industry. I didn’t know much and only found what was hot in the tech industry. But after tremendous research, I decided that Frontend Developer is what I want to do because it is suitable for my condition. I spend a year researching the tech industry, job types, and jobs and errors by joining communities and taking courses before landing on Frontend Developer. Switching from a non-technical background seems daunting because my previous job involved little to no problem-solving skills and computer science. I had no mentor and entirely relied on myself until I learned about the open source community, which is my most significant help. They listen to my doubt and guide me to the right path as long as we are eager to learn and seek it.
I’ve never used LinkedIn and made a resume throughout my whole career, which I know is bad news. It wore me out at first, but slowly I began to catch up to the phase where I had a tailored resume, LinkedIn and 500+ connections; I had 0 back then. I started my journey with Freecodecamp certifications, learning Git and GitHub, and some Udemy courses. I spend roughly 4 hours a day learning; I start my day with stock trading; in between, I’ll watch some videos or tinker with open source projects and end my day with 4-5 hours learning Frontend Tech Stack. Being self-taught always has the challenge of managing the time, commitment and how you rest. Despite that, I am ready to land my first job as a Frontend Developer at 2023.
